# ForTheBadge

```@index
```

This is a very simple package, which will generate a badge in the style of [ForTheBadge](https://forthebadge.com/).

```@docs
badge
```

Note that output SVGs have text drawn as a path by default, not as text; this is to ensure maximum portability.


# Examples

```@jldoctest
badge("USING", "MAKIE")
```
